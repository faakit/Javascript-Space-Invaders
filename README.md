## About
Space Invaders inspired game developed with the intent of familiarizing with the
JavaScript language. In this version of the classic the invaders continually descend
on the player, getting faster and increasing the rate of fire over time.

## How to Play
<kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd> moves the player;

<kbd>Space</kbd> shoots;

<kbd>m</kbd> mutes the game;

<kbd>p</kbd> disables some of the glow for improved performance.

## Performance Issues
The game seems to run better in chromium based browsers (tested in Brave, Edge and
Chrome). In FireFox the performance was very poor (with mild improvements without 
the glow).
